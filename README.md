# WRAP_Location_CaseStudy Package

To install
```
library(devtools)
install_github("eeholmes/WRAP")
```

To build

* When you create a project from the folder, RStudio will show a Build tab. Click 'Install and Restart' to rebuild. You only do this if you make changes to the code. Collaborators who are not modifying code just install from github.
* Before building however, Click Tools > Project Options > Build Tools and click the 'Generate Documentation with Roxygen'. Click 'Configure' and check 'Build and Reload' check box.


**This is work and code by Stephanie Brodie and collaborators.**

Simple simulation code to prepare for the WRAP Workshop March 23-25, 2020

OPERATING MODELS:

1. SimulateWorld_Function.R: this is the function that generates temperature dependent species distribution and abundance
2. SimulateWorld_ROMS_Function.R: this function uses temperature data from ROMS to generate species distribution and abundance
3. SimulateWorld_ROMS_TrophicInteraction_Function.R: this function uses temperature and chl-a to build suitability for two species, and generate distribution and abundance for one species. 

ESTIMATION MODELS:

1. ModelComparison.R: this code uses the function above to generate data, then builds an example GAM and BRT model, and makes predictions into the future 2020-2080. Couples with functions 1 and 2 above. 
2. ModelComparison_TrophicInteractions.R: this code uses the ROMS_TophicInteraction function above to generate data, then builds an example GAM and BRT model, and makes predictions into the future 2020-2080. Couples with functions 3 above. 

ROMS:
1. Create_ROMS_Rasters.R: code to turn downscaled ROMS netcdf files into rasters. Most users do not need to use this code.
