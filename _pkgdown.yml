      These vignettes provide an introduction to simulating presence/absence and 
      abundance grids using environmental variables and fitting Species Distribution
      Models using the **WRAP** package.

      Functions for simulating presence/absence and 
      abundance grids using environmental variables. These functions return an OM object.

  - title: "Fitting"
    desc: >
      Functions for fitting SDMs using GAMs, Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Neural Nets (MLP). 
      These functions take as input, a OM object as returned by the simulation functions above. The
      OM object has information (in object$meta) about the simulation that is used in the fitting function.
      The fitting functions return an object of class SDM that can be passed to prediction and plotting
      functions.

  - title: "Predicting"
    desc: >
      OMs can be passed to the predict function to create predictions. The model to use
      will be specified with the `model` argument. Alternatively a fitted model can be 
      passed in and that will be used for prediction. The predict.OM function returns an
      object of class POM.

  - title: "OM Methods"
    desc: >
      The simulation functions return an OM object (a list) with meta and grid. meta has information
      on the simulation and grid is the simulated grid (as a data frame with lat lon). The following
      methods are available in addition to the fitting functions above.
