\usage{
SimulateWorld_ROMS(
  PA_shape = c("logistic", "logistic_prev", "linear"),
  abund_enviro = c("lnorm_low", "lnorm_high", "poisson"),
  covariates = c("sst"),
  dir = file.path(here::here(), "Rasters_2d_monthly"),
  roms.years = 1980:2100,
  n.samples = 400
)
}
\arguments{
\item{PA_shape}{specifies how enviro suitability determines species presence-absence. takes values of "logistic" (SB original), "logistic_prev" (JS, reduces knife-edge), "linear" (JS, reduces knife edge, encourages more absences)}

\item{abund_enviro}{specifies abundance if present, can be "lnorm_low" (SB original), "lnorm_high" (EW), or "poisson" (JS, increases abundance range)}

\item{covariates}{A vector with "sst" and/or "chla". One or both can be listed.}

\item{dir}{(optional) The path to the directory where the folder 'gfdl' is.}

\item{roms.years}{The years for the ROMS data. The data files use the year and month. Default is 1980:2100.}

\item{n.samples}{The number of samples to take from the ROMS layers each year. Default is 400.}
}
\description{
Function uses covariate data from ROMS to generate species distribution and abundance.
}
\details{
The ROMS data are assumed to be in the working directory in a folder called 'Rasters_2d_monthly/gfdl/'. SST data are in a subfolder called 'sst_monthly'. If the ROMS data folder is different, you can pass that in via the 'dir' argument. However the ROMS data folder must have subfolders 'gfdl/sst_monthly' so that 'paste0(dir,"/gfdl/sst_monthly")' will find the SST ROMS data.

Caution: this function uses the downscaled GCMs to simulate species distrubtion. It has slight differences to the other SimulatedWorld_function that 'randomly' generates environmental data. Remember: 1980-2010 are not observed data (by design)
