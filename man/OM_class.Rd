\description{
This is the format for all output for the OM functions. The output is a list with
\strong{meta} A list with elements that describe the model used.
\itemize{
\item version: Version of WRAP package used.
\item func: Name of function that produced the grid.
\item call: Exact call used to run model.
\item sim.seed: The random seed used for the simulation to replicate the results .Random.seed <- sim.seed before rerunning the OM function. 
\item entries for all the arguments to the function (function dependent)
\item covariates: The covariates included in the model.
\item grid.dimensions: c(nrow, ncol, n cells).
\item grid.resolution: c(x, y)
\item grid.extent: c(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
\item grid.crs: grid coordinate system
\item grid.unit Eg. "degree" Add units for clarity. NA if grid is simulated for example a 20x20 grid.
\item time: c(start date, end date). For example  c(2001, 2101)
\item time.unit = "year" for yearly. 
}
\strong{grid} A data frame with a row for each grid square. The data frame has the following columns. Other columns can be added but at minimum the following are provided:
\itemize{
\item lat
\item lon
\item year
\item pres Presence/absence as 0/1
\item suitability
\item columns for the covariates (one column for each)
\item covariates: The covariates included in the model. The number of covariates will vary by model.
\item abundance
